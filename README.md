# biorealistic-v1-model

A project for making biorealistic model of mouse V1.
This is a successor project of making a model of the mouse primary visual cortex
(<https://portal.brain-map.org/explore/models/mv1-all-layers>)

The improvements are:

* Connection probability and weights are derived from coherent datasets, including the Allen Institute synaptic physiology data and MICrONS electron microscopy connectomics dataset (instead from the literature).
* Synaptic connections are now expressed by double alpha functions and the receptor types are more elaborated.
* Segregation of the L5 excitatory cells into IT, ET, and NP types.
* More GLIF cell models are used.

Only the PointNet version is available as of now.

- **[v1_functional_property](https://github.com/shixnya/v1_functional_property)** — Neuropixels-derived functional-property tables and related analysis scripts for V1 cell types.
- **[Prebuilt SONATA network files (Dropbox)](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/4i8tsihwokn78jpb6wqls/AE9ukbU8ShG1R5hQEdssxDg?rlkey=332wdyd2ou5yujy5us3eq89pc&st=pg2mabe6&dl=0)** — prebuilt network data for the TensorFlow workflow.

If you need a prebuilt SONATA network for the TensorFlow workflow, use the Dropbox link above or the download link in the network-building section below.

## System requirements

- **Operating system:** Linux is officially tested. macOS may work but is untested. Windows is not supported.
- **Hardware:** No GPU is required. The PointNet/NEST simulation workflow is CPU-based. Building the `full` (700 µm radius, ~203k neurons) network requires hundreds of GBs of memory and is typically run on a cluster; smaller network sizes (`core`, `small`, `tiny`) run on a workstation.

## Installation instructions

This repository documents the PointNet-based network-building and simulation workflow.
TensorFlow-based training workflows are documented in the companion `V1_GLIF_model`
repository. If you need the SONATA network for that workflow, build it here or download a
prebuilt network from [this Dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/4i8tsihwokn78jpb6wqls/AE9ukbU8ShG1R5hQEdssxDg?rlkey=332wdyd2ou5yujy5us3eq89pc&st=pg2mabe6&dl=0).
Included prebuilt networks are core_nll_0 through core_nll_9 (see below for details) with the following options:
- plain: fresh build with only BKG tuning (no suffix)
- bio_trained: edge weight trained with distribution constraints (suffix `_bio_trained` in the SONATA edges files)
- naive: edge weight trained without distribution constraints (suffix `_naive` in the SONATA edges files)


Start by cloning this repository locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AllenInstitute/biorealistic-v1-model.git
```

We recommend using [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) to set up the environment. Other conda variants also work, as long as `conda-forge` is the primary package source.

If you have `mamba` installed, you can use it in place of `conda`.

```bash
CONDA_CHANNEL_PRIORITY=strict conda env create -f environment.yml -n <env_name>
```

> **Note:** The `CONDA_CHANNEL_PRIORITY=strict` flag is required. Without it, the solver may hang because of the combination of multiple channels and strict version pins.

Activate the environment before running any commands in this repository:

```bash
conda activate <env_name>
```

The pip-section packages (`allensdk`, `pylightxl`, `sonata`) may not install cleanly during `conda env create`. If `allensdk` is missing after creating the environment, install the packages manually:

```bash
pip install allensdk pylightxl sonata
```

## How to build a network and run a simulation

The simplest way to obtain a network and its simulation output is to run the following:

```bash
snakemake <network_name>/output_plain/spikes.h5
```

where `<network_name>` is one of the defined names in `Snakefile`. Namely:

* `core`: 400 µm radius network. ~67k neurons.
* `core_X`: X is {0-9}. The number of neurons in each cell model has Poisson fluctuation.
* `core_nll`: Same geometry as core, but no weight like-to-like is used.
* `core_nll_X`: Same as core_X, but no weight like-to-like is used (used in the paper)
* `small`: 200 µm radius network.
* `tiny`: 100 µm radius network. Mainly for testing the build script.
* `profile`: For profiling workflows. 200 µm radius.
* `full`: The full size network (700 µm radius, ~203k neurons).

You can create a custom size if you define parameters in `Snakefile`.

Also, you can edit `V1model_seed_file.xlsx` to change what cell types are included. For example, if you want to make an L4-only network, you can delete all the cell types other than L4 from this file.

Building the `full` model requires hundreds of GBs of memory. It usually needs to be run on a cluster computer, but it is not incorporated in the snakemake workflow yet. If you really need the `full` network, running the build script should be done manually. The subsequent processes should work fine with snakemake once you build the model.

## Simulation pipelines for analysis

The analysis scripts in this repository expect simulation output that was generated using
specific stimulus paradigms. Each paradigm requires its own LGN (FilterNet) and
background spike inputs, followed by a PointNet V1 simulation. The general workflow for
every paradigm is:

1. **Build the network** — `snakemake <network_name>/network/v1_nodes.h5` (or the full build as described above).
2. **Generate background spikes** — `python bkg_spike_generation.py <network_name>` creates background spike files for all paradigms in one pass (`bkg/`, `bkg_8dir_10trials/`, `bkg_contrasts/`, `bkg_imagenet/`, `bkg_bo/`).
3. **Run FilterNet** (LGN) — produces LGN spike trains from visual stimuli. Config in `config_templates/config_filternet.json`.
4. **Run PointNet** (V1) — uses LGN + background spikes to simulate V1 activity. Config in `config_templates/config_<network_option>.json`.

Steps 3–4 are typically launched via SLURM job scripts generated by `make_*_jobs.py` helpers.
On a local machine with modest resources, you can run them directly with
`python run_filternet.py <config>` and `python run_pointnet.py <config> -n <threads>`.

### Network weight variants

Each network can be simulated with different weight files selected by the `network_option`
parameter. The main options used in the paper are:

* `plain` — Original untrained weights (as built).
* `bio_trained` — Weights after TensorFlow training with synaptic weight distribution constraints.
* `naive` — Weights after TensorFlow training without synaptic weight distribution constraints.

These map to config files `config_templates/config_<option>.json`, which point to the corresponding edge files (e.g., `v1_v1_edges_bio_trained.h5`). Trained edge files must
be placed in `<network_name>/network/` before running simulations.

### Drifting-grating simulations (Figures 3, 5, 6)

8 directions × 10 trials, 3 s each. Used for OSI/DSI metrics and preferred-direction analyses.

```bash
# 1. Generate FilterNet jobs (LGN responses to drifting gratings)
python make_osi_jobs.py <network_name> --filternet --memory 20

# 2. Submit FilterNet array job (cluster) or run locally
sbatch <network_name>/jobs/filternet_8dir_10trials.sh

# 3. Generate PointNet jobs for a given weight variant
python make_osi_jobs.py <network_name> --network_option bio_trained --memory 20

# 4. Submit PointNet array job
sbatch <network_name>/jobs/8dir_10trials_bio_trained.sh
```

Output lands in `<network_name>/8dir_10trials_<option>/angle<A>_trial<T>/spikes.h5`.
After all trials complete, compute OSI/DSI metrics:

```bash
python calculate_odsi.py <network_name> <network_option>
# → <network_name>/metrics/OSI_DSI_DF_<option>.csv
```

Snakemake shortcut (single network, single option):

```bash
snakemake core_nll_0/metrics/OSI_DSI_DF_bio_trained.csv
```

### Contrast-response simulations (Figures 3, 6)

8 directions × 6 contrasts (0.05–0.80) × 10 trials. Stimulus conditions are defined in
`stimulus_trials.py` (`ContrastStimulus` class).

```bash
# Generate and submit FilterNet + PointNet contrast jobs
python make_contrast_jobs.py <network_name> --filternet --memory 20
sbatch <network_name>/jobs/filternet_contrasts.sh

python make_contrast_jobs.py <network_name> --network_option bio_trained --memory 20
sbatch <network_name>/jobs/contrasts_bio_trained.sh
```

Output: `<network_name>/contrasts_<option>/angle<A>_contrast<C>_trial<T>/spikes.h5`.
After completion, aggregate spike counts and plot contrast-response curves:

```bash
python contrast_spike_aggregation.py <network_name> <network_option>
python contrast_analysis.py <network_name> <network_option>
```

### Brain Observatory natural-image simulations (Figure 4)

118 natural images from the Allen Brain Observatory, 250 ms each, repeated for 50
chunks (repetitions). Each chunk is ~30 s. These simulations are **not** included in the
Snakefile and must be set up manually.

Background spikes are generated automatically by `bkg_spike_generation.py` (stored in
`<network_name>/bkg_bo/bkg_bo_chunk_XX.h5`). FilterNet and PointNet configs for each
chunk need to be created by adapting the base config to point to the appropriate
FilterNet output and background file for each chunk.

Output convention: `<network_name>/output_bo_<option>/chunk_XX/spikes.h5`.

Once all 50 chunks are complete, cache firing-rate tensors for the decoding pipeline:

```bash
python -m image_decoding.cache_precompute --networks 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 --network_type bio_trained
```

See `image_decoding/README.md` for the full decoding and plotting workflow.

### Response-correlation computation (Figure 5)

After natural-image simulations (ImageNet or Brain Observatory) are complete, compute
pairwise response correlations between connected neurons:

```bash
python response_correlation_calculations.py --base_dir <network_name> --input_type <option>
# → <network_name>/metrics/response_correlations_<option>.npy
```

These `.npy` files are consumed by the Figure 5 correlation scripts
(`generate_corr_final_panel.py`, etc.).

### Suppression / silencing experiments (Figure 5)

These experiments suppress activity of specific neuron cohorts (e.g., high-outgoing-weight
excitatory cells, or specific inhibitory subtypes) and re-run drifting-grating simulations
to measure the effect on network activity.

```bash
# 1. Generate cohort node sets (identifies which neurons to suppress)
python analysis_shared/create_highlow_outgoing_weight_nodesets.py
python analysis_shared/create_celltype_nodesets.py

# 2. Generate silencing simulation configs
python analysis_shared/generate_fig5_outgoing_silencing_configs.py

# 3. Generate and submit SLURM jobs
python make_celltype_suppression_jobs.py
sbatch <network_name>/jobs/<suppression_job>.sh

# 4. Compute metrics from suppression output
python analysis_shared/calculate_celltype_suppression_metrics.py
```

Results are plotted by `figure_scripts/figure5/plot_celltype_suppression_boxplots.py`
and `plot_perturbation_heatmap_figure5.py`.

## Folders and files

base_props/: A folder that contains seed files that are necessary for building the network. These are mostly designed to be human readable and editable.

base_props/V1model_seed_file.xlsx: An excel file that contains general properties of
each cell population. Edit this when you want to change which cell population is used
and their numbers.

base_props/exclude_list.csv: Cells listed in this file will be excluded from the model. The reasons could vary, but generally due to undesired properties in the model, such as spiny inhibitory cells, aspiny excitatory cells, or that the model does not well reproduce cell's activity.

base_props/bkg_weights_population.csv: This file defines synaptic weights from background cell (currently, there is only one entity for background source) to each cell population. The synaptic weights in this file are copied from the previous model (except for L5 which is average of the two types in the previous model), and are parameters of the optimization stage later.

Preferred data storage option is CSV format, as long as the data are not large. All the csv files are 'space' separarated (to match with SONATA format). Larger data can be stored as h5 data frame. All should be readable in pandas.


## Analysis and figure generation

This repository also contains the analysis code used to generate all figures in the paper.
Analysis results are produced by running standalone Python scripts from the repo root
with the `new_v1` conda environment activated.

The code is organized into four layers:

1. **Root-level utility modules** — Low-level loaders and computation routines (`network_utils.py`, `calculate_odsi.py`, etc.) that most other scripts depend on.
2. **`analysis_shared/`** — A shared library of reusable analysis functions: data I/O, cell-type grouping, statistical fitting, weight-vs-activity analyses, cohort generation, and perturbation metrics.
3. **`figure_scripts/`** — Per-figure panel generators organized by figure number (`figure3/` through `figure6/`, plus `extended_data/`). Each script produces one or more publication panels.
4. **`image_decoding/`** — A self-contained sub-package for natural-image decoding analyses (Figure 4), with its own preprocessing, decoding, and plotting modules. See `image_decoding/README.md`.

Experimental reference data live in `neuropixels/` (Neuropixels OSI/DSI metrics) and
`analysis_shared/*.pkl` (MICrONS EM data). Extended documentation is in `docs/`.

## Notes
In the new V1 model, the LGN coordinates are defined as the visual field coordinates
(elevation and azimuth), though these coordinates are not zero-centered.
The LGN’s elevation axis is oriented upward, aligning with the V1 model’s z-axis;
however, this may conflict with conventional image coordinate systems, where row indices
increase downward. Note that this definition differs from our previous model (Billeh et
al., 2020), which defined the LGN coordinate axis as downward.
Use the y_dir and flip_y options in BMTK to control image orientation when presenting
data to this network.
